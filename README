Game Description:
-Falling Blocks is a competitive block dodging game. Each user will attempt to achieve the highest score on the leaderboard for the rank and prestige associated with it.
-Players must contend with a series of random falling objects trying to slay the player and end their score, each block dodged provides points to the player.
-At the same time the player can see the actions of another play while they play and have that as an additional distraction.

Potential Add-Ons: 
ChatBox: Will allow all players who are in the game to communicate with one another, discuss strategies, and set up games.
Head to Head: Would allow players to play one on one against each other to see who can survive the longest in a progressively more challenging block falling competition!
Individual Server Setup: Would be a ServerConfig.exe, which with the right files downloaded would allow the user to create and host their own server. This server would then be added
to a list of playable servers.

Connecting to Server:
Open the login page, log in to the game or make an account and then join a game!
